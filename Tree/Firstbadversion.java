//You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version
// of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version,
// all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
//Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the
// following ones to be bad.
//You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function
// to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
//Example 1:
//Input: n = 5, bad = 4
//Output: 4
//Explanation:
//call isBadVersion(3) -> false
//call isBadVersion(5) -> true
//call isBadVersion(4) -> true
//Then 4 is the first bad version.
//Example 2:
//Input: n = 1, bad = 1
//Output: 1
